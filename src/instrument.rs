The caller can specify the type of lock requested—exclusive or shared lock—and the length of time the operation will suspend while waiting to acquire the lock before timing out. This operation can also be used for sharing and nesting locks.
    ///
    /// The session that gained a shared lock can pass the accessKey to other sessions for the purpose of sharing the lock. The session wanting to join the group of sessions sharing the lock can use the key as an input value to the requestedKey parameter. VISA will add the session to the list of sessions sharing the lock, as long as the requestedKey value matches the accessKey value for the particular resource. The session obtaining a shared lock in this manner will then have the same access privileges as the original session that obtained the lock.
    ///
    ///It is also possible to obtain nested locks through this operation. To acquire nested locks, invoke the viLock() operation with the same lock type as the previous invocation of this operation. For each session, viLock() and viUnlock() share a lock count, which is initialized to 0. Each invocation of viLock() for the same session (and for the same lockType) increases the lock count. In the case of a shared lock, it returns with the same accessKey every time. When a session locks the resource a multiple number of times, it is necessary to invoke the viUnlock() operation an equal number of times in order to unlock the resource. That is, the lock count increments for each invocation of viLock(), and decrements for each invocation of viUnlock(). A resource is actually unlocked only when the lock count is 0.
    ///
    ///The VISA locking mechanism enforces arbitration of accesses to resources on an individual basis. If a session locks a resource, operations invoked by other sessions to the same resource are serviced or returned with a locking error, depending on the operation and the type of lock used. If a session has an exclusive lock, other sessions cannot modify global attributes or invoke operations, but can still get attributes and set local attributes. If the session has a shared lock, other sessions that have shared locks can also modify global attributes and invoke operations. Regardless of which type of lock a session has, if the session is closed without first being unlocked, VISA automatically performs a viUnlock() on that session.
    ///
    ///The locking mechanism works for all processes and resources existing on the same computer. When using remote resources, however, the networking protocol may not provide the ability to pass lock requests to the remote device or resource. In this case, locks will behave as expected from multiple sessions on the same computer, but not necessarily on the remote device. For example, when using the VXI-11 protocol, exclusive lock requests can be sent to a device, but shared locks can only be handled locally.
